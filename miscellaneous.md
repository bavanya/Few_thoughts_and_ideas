Applications of Hidden Markov Model:
1. Computational finance
2. speed analysis
3. Speech recognition
4. Speech synthesis
5. Part-of-speech tagging
6. Document separation in scanning solutions
7. Machine translation
8. Handwriting recognition
9. Time series analysis
10. Activity recognition
11. Sequence classification
12. Transportation forecasting 

Based on HMM:
1. Likelihood of a given observed sequence can be computed using the forward algorithm.
2. The Viterbi algorithm and the posterior-Viterbi algorithm are used for predicting a corresponding hidden sequence for a given observed sequence.
3. Both the Transition probability matrix and the Emission probability matrix (both the parameters of a HMM) can be trained with the Baum-Welch or
forward-backward algorithm.
